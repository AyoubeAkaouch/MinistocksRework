        <h2>Entering stocks</h2>

        <h3>Entering stock symbols</h3>

        <p>Stock symbols must be in the Yahoo format, which you can look up on the Yahoo Finance website.</p>

        <p><a id="selectingviews" href="#quicklinks">back to top</a></p>

        <h2>Selecting widget views</h2>

        <p>The widget has multiple views that display different information.</p>

        <p>These views can be turned on from the Widget views menu in settings.</p>

        <p>Once selected, the views can be changed on your home screen by touching the right-side of the widget.</p>

        <p>If a stock does not have information for a particular view, then the daily percentage change will instead be
            displayed for that stock in blue.</p>

        <h3>Daily change %</h3>

        <p>Shows the current stock price with the daily percentage change.</p>

        <h3>Daily change (DA)</h3>

        <p>Shows the current stock price with the daily price change.</p>

        <h3>Total change % (PF T%)</h3>

        <p>Shows the current stock price with the total percentage change from the buy price in the portfolio.</p>

        <h3>Total change (PF TA)</h3>

        <p>Shows the current stock price with the total price change from the buy price in the portfolio.</p>

        <h3>Total change AER % (PF AER)</h3>

        <p>Shows the current stock price with the annualised percentage change using the buy price in the portfolio.</p>

        <h3>P/L daily change % (P/L D%)</h3>

        <p>Shows your current holding value with the daily percentage change.</p>

        <h3>P/L daily change (P/L DA)</h3>

        <p>Shows your current holding value with the daily price change.</p>

        <h3>P/L total change % (P/L T%)</h3>

        <p>Shows your current holding value with the total percentage change from the buy cost in the portfolio.</p>

        <h3>P/L total change (P/L TA)</h3>

        <p>Shows your current holding value with the total value change from the buy cost in the portfolio.</p>

        <h3>P/L total change AER (P/L AER)</h3>

        <p>Shows your current holding value with the annualised percentage change using the buy cost in the
            portfolio.</p>

        <p><a id="usingportfolio" href="#quicklinks">back to top</a></p>

        <h2>Using the portfolio</h2>

        <p>On the portfolio screen you will see all the stocks that you have entered in your widgets in one list.</p>

        <p>You can touch an item to enter your stock purchase details.</p>

        <h3>Entering purchase details</h3>

        <p>Enter the price that you bought the stock for, this will then be used for the Portfolio and Profit and loss
            widget views.</p>

        <p>The Date is optional, and will be used for the AER rate on the portfolio AER and profit and loss AER
            views.</p>

        <p>The Quantity is optional, and will be used to calculate your holdings for the profit and loss views. You may
            use negative values to simulate a short position.</p>

        <p>The High price limit and Low price limit are optional. When the current price hits these limits, the price
            color will change in the widget.</p>

        <h3>Removing purchase details</h3>

        <p>To remove purchase and alert details, long press the portfolio item and then choose the Clear details
            option.</p>

        <p><a id="updatingprices" href="#quicklinks">back to top</a></p>

        <h2>Updating prices</h2>

        <p>You can set how often, and when the widget updates in the Advanced settings menu. The setting applies
            globally to all the widgets.</p>

        <p>Stock price information is provided by Yahoo Finance, and there may be a delay (from real-time prices, to up
            to 30 minutes) for some exchanges.</p>

        <p>Note that the time in the lower-left of the widget is the time that the data was retrieved from Yahoo, not
            the time of the live price.</p>

        <p>If an internet connection is not present when an update occurs, the widget will just use the last shown data,
            and the time for that data.

        <h3>Update prices now feature</h3>

        <p>This will update the prices in all your widgets, if there is an internet connection available.</p>
