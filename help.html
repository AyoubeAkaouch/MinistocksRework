        <h2>Entering stocks</h2>

        <h3>Entering stock symbols</h3>

        <p>Stock symbols must be in the Yahoo format, which you can look up on the Yahoo Finance website.</p>

        <h2>Selecting widget views</h2>

        <p>The widget has multiple views that display different information.</p>

        <p>These views can be turned on from the Widget views menu in settings.</p>

        <p>Once selected, the views can be changed on your home screen by touching the right-side of the widget.</p>

        <p>If a stock does not have information for a particular view, then the daily percentage change will instead be
            displayed for that stock in blue.</p>
